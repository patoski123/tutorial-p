# Client
#
# Used as the tool to interact with the API in your tests.
#
# You can:
#
# Send requests more easily (instead of writing raw HTTP calls).
#
# Reuse functions/classes for common operations (e.g. create_user(), get_orders()).
#
# Encapsulate authentication, headers, base URLs, retries, etc.
#
# Example in Python:
#
# A wrapper built on httpx or requests.
